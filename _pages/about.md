I am a video game artisan who dream about making my own video games. In the past of my life, I trained my program engineering skill as a game engine programer. then I acquired computer graphic knowledge and researching skills as a M.S. in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by Prof. [Rui Wang](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/rwang/) and [Yuchi Huo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/yuchihuo). In the future, I will crash into different thought and technique that outside the computer and sketch out the shape of **MY GAME**.
