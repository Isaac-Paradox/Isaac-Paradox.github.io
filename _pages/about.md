I am a video game artisan who dream about making my own video games. In the past of my life, I trained my program engineering skill as a game engine programer. then I acquired computer graphic knowledge and researching skills as a M.S. in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by Prof. [Rui Wang](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/rwang/) and [Yuchi Huo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/yuchihuo). In the future, I will crash into different thought and technique that outside the computer and sketch out the shape of **MY GAME**.

## Research Interests

I'm instersting in any research that can help artist focus on creativity or expand possibility in art creation. So my research interest including but not limited to: 1. AICG method that can create contents and alleviate the labor of hand-crafting; 2. real-time acceleration algorithm, such as superresolution for real-time rendering, that can enlarge the capacity the contents in virtual scenes or give more alternative trade-off strategies.
